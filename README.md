FORAGINGTECH
============

This is an application for AR.Drone version 2. Be aware of that it only works for AR.Drone version 2, not version 1. This application has 3 main functions: 1) Manual Control, 2) Navigating Control, 3) Image Processing. Manual control is the basic control using two joypads on the screen. Navigating control is seting up a path and making a drone follow the path. Image processing can be used in manual control mode that can show processed image, such as Canny Edge detection, Hough Circle, Hough Circle for only red color circles.


TODO FOR INSTALLATION
============

1. I only tested this application using Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, Android version 17. If the screen resolution is smaller than 1280 x 800, some of interfaces may not be shown on the screen, and if device version is lower than 17, it cannot be installed on a device.

2. I used openCV library to process images. You need to install openCV manager before launching foragingtech application. To download openCV manager, visit https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opencv.engine
